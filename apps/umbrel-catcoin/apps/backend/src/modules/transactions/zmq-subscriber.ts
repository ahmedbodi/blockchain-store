// Bitcoin Core's ZMQ `pubhashtx` transaction notifier is NOT SILENT during IBD and initial Bitcoin Core startup (unlike `pubhashblock`)
// We  wait until the mempool is loaded and IBD is complete before subscribing to `pubhashtx` or else we would receive a flood of tx notifications during startup and all throughout IBD
//
// IBD behaviour:
// During IBD, the node is validating old blocks; every "new-to-mempool" tx found in those blocks still triggers a `pubhashtx` notification.
//
// Mempool behaviour:
// On startup, as soon as the node finishes reading `mempool.dat` it replays every tx it loaded (likely tens of thousands on a mainnet node) – each one fires a `hashtx`.
